                            <p>Koalas are Australia's national treasures and are Australia's peculiar and precious primitive arboreal animals. The koala is a small bear-like, tree-dwelling animal, which averages about 9 kilograms in weight. Its fur is thick and usually ash grey. Koalas are mainly distributed in low-altitude, low-density eucalyptus forests in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The koala gets its name from an ancient Aboriginal word meaning "no drink" because it receives over 90% of it's water from the Eucalyptus leaves (also known as gum leaves) it eats, and only drinks when ill or times when there is not enough moisture in the leaves.</p>

                                <p>Koalas are generally classified as nocturnal animals, and they are active at night and at dawn, because this can save water and energy consumption more than activities when the temperature is high during the day. During the day, the body is usually curled up and perched on the eucalyptus tree. At night, go out for activities, climb up and down along the branches, and look for the eucalyptus leaves. He spends most of his life living on eucalyptus trees, but occasionally falls to the ground by replacing perching trees or devouring gravel that helps digestion. They feed on eucalyptus leaves and twigs. Eucalyptus leaves are their only food. They almost never drink water because they get enough water from the eucalyptus leaves. The natural enemies facing koalas in nature are mainly Australian wild dogs, foxes and eagles.</p>

                                    Koalas live in societies, just like humans, so they need to be able to come into contact with other koalas. It is because of this they need to have areas of suitable eucalypt forest, which are large enough to support a healthy koala population and to allow for expansion by maturing young koalas. The loss and fragmentation of koala habitat caused by human activities is the biggest threat to koala populations. Human activities such as urbanization in the coastal areas of Australia and the reclamation of jungles in the inland areas have led to a sharp decline in the number of koalas.
                                </p>
                                <p>In order to save koalas, many volunteers in Australia began adopting koalas. They carefully nurtured orphaned little koala orphans, carefully treated koalas injured in the wild, and put them back into the wild to enrich the population when koalas matured or recovered.</p>

                            <p>Since Australia entered the wildfire season, catastrophic bushfires have not only caused huge losses to the human economy but also brought a heavy blow to biodiversity and ecosystem functions. More than 60,000 square kilometers of forest were destroyed, equivalent to 60 times the California fire and 7 times the Amazon fire, and emitted approximately 350 million tons of carbon dioxide.</p>

                                    Due to the bushfires, plumes of “black carbon” have traveled more than 7000 miles from the fires. Black carbon is harmful to biological health, air quality, and contributes to climate change.

                                    The bushfires already create their weather to a vicious cycle. The flow above shows how bush-fore create their climate. However, this is not the first bushfire in Australia, which has seen large and small fires in the past year. Fires killed more than 1,300 people in 1939. In 1967, a similar number died, 1,293. In 1983, More than 2,000 people died. In 2009, the highest number of deaths was 2,029, known as “Black Saturday”.

                                    So why don't people stop the fire? If you don't have an idea of how fast a fire can spread, take a look at this chart. Australia ’s forest fires raged, about 1.25 billion native animals died in recent bushfires in Australia. As many as 8,400 koalas may have died in the fires in new south wales alone, and the number is rising. More seriously, the koala ’s habitat was severely damaged by the blaze, and its survival was facing challenges.

                                    Australian Environment Minister (Ley) said that 28,000 koalas inhabit the north-central coast of New South Wales. The bushfires in recent months have damaged the ecological environment, causing 30% of local koalas to die. The specific situation will not be evaluated until the fire gradually subsides.The Australian Koala Foundation has warned that the koala is on the verge of extinction due to the bushfire. There are only 80,000 koalas growing in the wild in Australia. This number is not enough to breed and regenerate the next generation, which is "functional extinction." Several environmental organizations joined the Australian Koala Foundation and made every effort to save this species.

For Koalas, northern New South Wales is the best habitat, where the soil is fertile, however, the bushfires since November have severely damaged Koala ’s homes.The Minister of the Environment said that one-third of Koala ’s habitat in New South Wales has been destroyed. However, the Australian government has prepared a budget of 6 million US dollars to improve the living environment of surviving koalas.</p>
